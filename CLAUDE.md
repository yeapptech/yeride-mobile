# CLAUDE.md — AI Assistant Guide for YeRide-Next

**Last updated:** April 28, 2026 (Phase 5 turn 3)
**Codebase:** the clean-architecture rewrite of YeRide. New project at
`/Users/papagallo/yeapptech/dev/yeride-mobile/`. Legacy app still lives at
`/Users/papagallo/yeapptech/dev/yeride/` and is the source of truth for
domain knowledge — read its `CLAUDE.md` for trip lifecycle, Stripe,
Navigation SDK quirks, and other behaviors not yet ported.

## Project status

Phase 5 turn 3 complete. Turn 1 shipped the Vehicle domain + DTO + 3
in-memory fakes. Turn 2 shipped real adapters
(`FirestoreVehicleRepository`, `FirebaseStorageVehiclePhotoRepository`,
`NhtsaVinDecoderService`), the 9 vehicle-management use cases, and the
DI / TestContainerProvider wiring. Turn 3 shipped the driver-facing
UI: `VehicleClassifier` domain service (manual-entry classifier +
eligible-services map), the vehicle queries layer (decode + register +
setActive + delete mutations), `useVehicleListViewModel` +
`useVehicleRegistrationViewModel`, the `VehicleListScreen` +
`VehicleRegistrationScreen` screens, four supporting components
(`DriverVehicleCard`, `VinEntryStep`, `DecodedPreviewStep`,
`ManualEntryStep`), and a role-gated "My vehicles" entry inside the
shared `UserProfileScreen`. Phase 4 (driver UI) is complete behind
this. Phase 3 shipped the full rider journey end-to-end against real
Firebase. Phase 5 turn 4 (VehiclePhotos + VehicleDetails + retire
`'vehicle-stub'`) is next.

End of Phase 4 acceptance: **81 test suites / 568 tests passing**;
typecheck + lint + format + test all green. Driver can sign in → go
online → accept an offer → land on DriverMonitor → flip to at-pickup
→ start ride → request payment → either land on the
`payment_requested` spinner and auto-redirect on `completed`, or land
on the `payment_failed` card and tap "Close trip" → return to
DriverHome. Cancel from any cancel-eligible status uses the full
per-reason `DriverCancelReasonSheet`.

End of Phase 5 turn 2 acceptance: **97 test suites / 708 tests passing**
(+10 suites / +47 tests over Phase 5 turn 1's 87/661); typecheck, lint,
format, and test all green. The 9 vehicle-management use cases are
wired through the DI container against real Firestore + Storage +
NHTSA adapters in production builds, in-memory fakes + real keyless
NHTSA in dev / test builds, and `InMemoryVehicleRepository` /
`InMemoryVehiclePhotoRepository` / `FakeVinDecoderService` overridable
via `TestContainerProvider`.

End of Phase 5 turn 3 acceptance: **102 test suites / 772 tests passing**
(+5 suites / +64 tests over Phase 5 turn 2's 97/708); typecheck, lint,
format, and test all green. A signed-in driver can open Profile → tap
"My vehicles" → see their list (or empty-state CTA) → tap "Add vehicle"
→ enter a VIN → see the decoded preview (or fall through to manual
entry on no-match / network error) → confirm → land back on the list
with the new vehicle marked active (first-vehicle auto-active).
Activate a non-active card by tapping it; trash + Alert-confirm
soft-deletes. Manual-entry vehicles run through `VehicleClassifier`
(luxury → xl → crossover → sedan compact/mid-size → wagon → coupe/
hatchback → economy) and get the same `eligibleServices` list the
NHTSA path produces. The `'vehicle-stub'` literal in
`useDriverHomeViewModel` is intentionally still in place — Turn 4
retires it once the photos UX lands.

**Layer dependency rule (enforced by eslint-plugin-boundaries):**

```
presentation → app → domain
data        → domain        (data implements domain interfaces)
shared      → domain        (only — shared is the ground floor)
```

`presentation` cannot import from `data`; `app` cannot import from
`presentation` or `data`; `domain` imports nothing else. The DI container
in `src/presentation/di/container.ts` is the single composition root that
wires data adapters into use cases — boundaries-rule overrides for that
file are listed in `eslint.config.js`.

## Code conventions (locked in across Phases 0–3)

### Result over throw

Every operation that can fail in an expected way returns
`Result<T, DomainError>` and never throws. Use `Result.ok` / `Result.err`
factories. Programming errors (network catastrophes, broken SDK state)
still throw; domain failures don't.

```ts
async signIn(args: { email: Email; password: string }):
  Promise<Result<UserId, NotFoundError | AuthorizationError>> {
  if (!found) return Result.err(new NotFoundError({ code: 'auth_user_not_found', ... }));
  return Result.ok(uid);
}
```

### Branded IDs

`UserId`, `RideId`, `ServiceAreaId`, `RideServiceId` are branded strings
(`Brand<string, 'UserId'>`) so the type system rejects passing one where
the other is expected. Always `.create()` to construct, returning
`Result<X, ValidationError>`.

### Value objects with `Result`-returning factories

`Money`, `Coordinates`, `Email`, `PhoneNumber`, `PersonName`, `Address`,
`SavedPlace`, `Endpoint`, `PassengerSnapshot`, `DriverSnapshot`, etc. all
use private constructors + `static create(props)` factories returning
Result. They're immutable — every "evolve" method returns a new
instance.

### Immutable entities with transition methods

`Ride` is the canonical example. Every state transition is a method
returning `Result<Ride, ValidationError>` that produces a new entity:

```ts
ride.dispatch({ driver, pickupDirections, at }); // awaiting_driver → dispatched
ride.start({ odometerMeters, at }); // dispatched → started
ride.requestPayment({ odometerMeters, at }); // started → payment_requested
ride.markCompleted(); // payment_requested → completed
ride.cancel({ reason, by, at, odometerMeters }); // any active → cancelled
```

Illegal transitions (e.g. completing a not-yet-started ride) return
`Result.err(ValidationError({code: 'ride_illegal_transition', ...}))`
rather than throwing.

### Repository pattern with lazy-required adapters

`buildContainer()` in `src/presentation/di/container.ts` decides between
real adapters (`FirebaseAuthRepository`, `FirestoreRideRepository`, etc.)
and in-memory fakes (`InMemoryAuthRepository`, …) based on
`Constants.expoConfig.extra.firebaseConfigured`. **All adapter imports
inside `buildContainer` use `require()` lazily** so:

- A fakes-only build never bundles `@react-native-firebase/*` (which
  would crash at module-load time without config files).
- The test environment never tries to load native modules.

```ts
if (isFirebaseConfigured()) {
  const data = require('@data/repositories/FirestoreRideRepository') as { … };
  return makeUseCases({ rides: new data.FirestoreRideRepository(), … });
}
const testing = require('@shared/testing') as { … };
return makeUseCases({ rides: new testing.InMemoryRideRepository(), … });
```

### Cloud Function callables hidden behind repositories

`requestPayment` and `cancel` on `RideRepository` route through
`CloudFunctionsService` (`completeTrip` / `cancelTrip` callables in
`us-east1`) but the use cases don't know — same interface as the
direct-write methods. The split between direct Firestore writes and
Cloud Function calls is an implementation detail of the data layer, not
a domain concern.

### Permissive DTO parsing, canonical writes

DTOs accept legacy field aliases (`seat` alongside `seatCapacity`,
`polyline` alongside `encodedPolyline`, missing optional fields) so the
rewrite reads any legacy document. Writes use the canonical (newer)
field shapes — but trip writes use Firestore `setDoc { merge: true }` so
fields the rewrite doesn't track yet (`lastSeenByRiderAt`,
`messages` subcollection) are preserved.

### Subscription-shaped use cases

`ObserveAuthState`, `ObserveRide`, `SubscribeToUserLocation`, etc. are
subscription-shaped (return synchronous unsubscribe), not
request/response. Don't try to force them into `execute(): Promise<…>`.

The legacy `subscribeToUserLocation` returned a Promise — explicitly
rewritten to synchronous unsubscribe to fix the React effect-cleanup
footgun. Never reintroduce async-unsubscribe.

### Role-gated use-case boundaries

`CancelRideByRider` enforces the rider-allowed set (`changed_mind`,
`driver_no_show`, …) and rejects driver-only codes (`passenger_no_show`).
`CancelRideByDriver` enforces the symmetric driver set. The `Ride`
entity's `cancel` method is symmetric on `by` because the entity doesn't
know who's calling — the role check belongs at the use case (the audit
boundary), not in the entity.

### Pricing in `Money` minor units

Every fare / price / fee field is a `Money` value object (USD minor
units). Math runs in minor units so we never accumulate floating-point
error. Wire-format conversions (legacy stores dollars as plain numbers)
happen at the mapper boundary only. `Money.fromMajor(2.5, 'USD')` →
`{minorUnits: 250, currency: 'USD'}`.

### Logging

Never `console.*` directly. Use `LOG.extend('ModuleName')` from
`@shared/logger`. Levels map to native console methods correctly
(important: `LOG.info` shows as `INFO`, not `WARN` — fixed in Phase 1
follow-up).

```ts
import { LOG } from '@shared/logger';
const logger = LOG.extend('RIDE');
logger.info('dispatched', { tripId, driverId });
logger.error('updateLocation failed', e);
```

PII protection: `sanitizeForLogging(meta)` is wired into the logger
transport — passing a User object to `meta` automatically redacts
email/phone/payment.

### Async / Result composition

Use `if (!r.ok) return r;` early-return pattern; don't use `.then`
chains. Use cases run server-side validation + auth before any side
effect, and sequence results explicitly:

```ts
const userR = await this.users.getById(id);
if (!userR.ok) return userR;
const updatedR = userR.value.updatePhone(newPhone);
if (!updatedR.ok) return updatedR;
return this.users.update(updatedR.value);
```

### View-model hooks per screen (Phase 3)

Every screen has a sibling `useXxxViewModel.ts` hook in
`src/presentation/features/<area>/view-models/` that owns the screen's
orchestration: pulls use cases off the DI container, wires TanStack
Query for server state, reads/writes the relevant Zustand store(s),
maps domain `Result` values to flat UI props (loading/error/data
discriminated unions), and exposes typed callbacks. Screens stay dumb —
no `useUseCases()` calls, no Firebase imports, no Result-unwrapping.

Test view-models in isolation with the in-memory repository fakes via
`TestContainerProvider`; screens get rendered tests that supply the
view-model output as props.

### Zustand vs. TanStack Query — split of concerns

Strict split, never mix:

- **TanStack Query** owns _server state_ (anything fetched or
  subscribed via a use case) — list of available rides, the current
  Ride doc, route catalog, payment methods. Query keys mirror use case
  args.
- **Zustand stores** own _client/UI state_ only — the trip-draft a
  rider is composing pre-CreateRide (`useTripDraftStore`), chat
  open/closed flag (`useChatUiStore`), geofence-warning banner
  visibility (`useGeofenceUiStore`), session identity bag
  (`useSessionStore`), the resolved active service area
  (`useServiceAreaStore`).

Do not put server-fetched ride data in Zustand. Do not put pure UI
flags in TanStack Query.

### Status-router pattern for live trip surfaces

Both `RideMonitorScreen` (rider) and `DriverMonitorScreen` (driver) use
a status-router: a single switch on `Ride.status` selects which
bottom-sheet view component renders. Rider views: `AwaitingDriverView`,
`DispatchedView`, `StartedView`, `CompletedView`, `PaymentFailedView`.
Driver views (Turn 4a): `EnRouteToPickupView`, `AtPickupView`. The
driver side adds a thin client-side `arrivedAtPickup` boolean to split
server status `'dispatched'` into the en-route ↔ at-pickup distinction
— UI-only, no server write. Phase 7's geofence-entry event will
auto-flip it. Each view is independently
testable, gets the `Ride` + callbacks as props, and never reads from
the store directly. Adding a new ride status = add a `RideStatus`
literal + add one component + extend the router. Don't grow a single
god-component.

## Data co-existence with legacy yeride

**Critical decision (REFACTOR_PLAN.md §7 Decision 6):** dev + stage
share the same `yeapp-stage` Firebase project as the legacy app, and
trips/users/locations live in the SAME Firestore collections. The
rewrite reads what legacy writes and vice versa. This means:

- DTO schemas must accept every legacy field shape we've ever seen.
- Doc writes must include canonical fields the legacy app reads (e.g.
  bake `seat: 4` AND `seatCapacity: 4` on ride-service snapshots).
- Trip writes use `setDoc { merge: true }` so we don't clobber fields
  the rewrite doesn't track yet.
- Cloud Functions are deployed once and called by both apps — keep
  function signatures byte-identical.

Production (post-cutover): fresh `yeapp-prod` Firebase project, only the
new app writes to it.

## Build & deployment

### Local dev

```bash
npm run start         # Metro dev server (--dev-client)
npm run prebuild      # expo prebuild --clean + node scripts/patch-podfile.js
npm run ios           # iOS simulator
npm run android       # Android emulator
```

`prebuild` is gated on the Firebase config files in
`firebase/config/<env>/`. With files: real Firebase wired. Without
files: in-memory fakes, with a `LOG.warn` at boot.

### Verify gates

```bash
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint           # eslint .
npm run format:check   # prettier --check .
npm test               # jest
npm run verify         # all four in sequence
```

All four must be green before commit. CI runs the same.

### Env vars

Live in `.env.development` / `.env.stage` / `.env.production`. Currently
configured:

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_ENV` — required, one of dev/stage/production
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_FIREBASE` — toggles real-vs-fakes (also respects
  config-file presence)
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_APIKEY_ANDROID` / `GOOGLE_MAPS_APIKEY_IOS` — read at
  build time, threaded through `app.config.ts` `extra`. NOT prefixed
  with `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` so they don't ship in the bundle string blob.

## Common tasks

### Adding a use case

1. New file in `src/app/usecases/<context>/<UseCaseName>.ts`.
2. Constructor takes whatever repos / services it needs.
3. `execute(args): Promise<Result<T, DomainError>>` (or sync for
   subscription-shaped).
4. Wire into `src/presentation/di/container.ts`'s `UseCases` interface
   - `makeUseCases()` body.
5. Tests in `__tests__/<UseCaseName>.test.ts` using
   `InMemory<X>Repository` fakes from `@shared/testing`.

### Adding a domain entity

1. New file in `src/domain/entities/<Name>.ts`.
2. Private constructor + `static create(props): Result<X, ValidationError>`
   factory.
3. Tests in `__tests__/<Name>.test.ts` covering happy path + every
   validation rejection (one assertion per `code` string).
4. Re-export via `src/domain/entities/index.ts` only if multiple files
   need it (most stay direct-imported).

### Adding a Firestore repository

1. Define the interface in `src/domain/repositories/<X>Repository.ts`.
2. Build the in-memory fake first in
   `src/shared/testing/InMemory<X>Repository.ts` — exercise the contract.
3. Build the real adapter in
   `src/data/repositories/Firestore<X>Repository.ts` (and a `<X>Doc.ts`
   schema + bidirectional mapper if persistence is needed).
4. Wire into the DI container with a lazy `require()`.
5. Add an optional override to `TestContainerProvider`.

## Troubleshooting

### iOS build: modular-headers + RNFirebase under static frameworks

`@react-native-firebase` 24.x's Obj-C wrappers do `#import <React/...>`
which Clang rejects under `useFrameworks: 'static'`. Three coupled fixes
applied by `scripts/patch-podfile.js`:

1. `Podfile.properties.json`: `ios.buildReactNativeFromSource: "true"`
   so React-Core builds from source (the prebuilt binary has no module
   map).
2. `Podfile`: `$RNFirebaseAsStaticFramework = true` at top level.
3. `Podfile`: `use_modular_headers!` inside the target.

If a NEW pod errors with non-modular include, add a targeted
`pod 'X', :modular_headers => true` to the patch script.

### Android: `compileSdkVersion 35` AAR-metadata error

AndroidX libs pulled in transitively (browser/core/core-ktx 1.17+)
require `compileSdk >= 36`. Fixed in `app.config.ts` `expo-build-properties`
block: `compileSdkVersion: 36, targetSdkVersion: 35`. Bumping `compileSdk`
only opens new APIs at compile time; runtime behavior stays at sdk 35.

### Firebase Auth on Android: `auth/internal-error` on signInWithEmailAndPassword

Driver/dev keystore SHA-1 not registered with the Firebase Android app
for `tech.yeapp.yeridenext.dev`. Get SHA-1 via:

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore \
  -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android | grep SHA1
```

Add it in Firebase Console → Project Settings → your Android app → Add
fingerprint, re-download `google-services.json`, replace in
`firebase/config/<env>/`, re-run `npm run prebuild && npm run android`.

### Logger says WARN for an info message

Don't use `console.*` directly anywhere except `src/shared/logger/Logger.ts`.
Use `LOG.extend('Module').info(...)`. The transport correctly routes
each level — if you see WARN tags on info messages, something is calling
`console.warn` directly somewhere it shouldn't be.

### Firestore `.get()` hangs but `onSnapshot` works

Firebase BoM 34.10.0 has gRPC stream stability issues. Legacy yeride
pins to BoM 34.0.0 in its `withNavigationSdk.js`. We don't pin yet; if
this surfaces, look at the legacy plugin for the fix. Watch for it
during heavy `getDoc` use in the rider UI work.

### iOS RCTFatal on boot: "missing usage descriptions" / `EXBaseLocationRequester getPermissions`

`expo-location` hard-fails (`RCTFatal`) the first time
`requestForegroundPermissionsAsync()` is called if the iOS Info.plist
is missing `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` /
`NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`. Crashes the entire app
on boot because `useCurrentLocation` mounts on every map-bearing
screen.

The strings ARE configured in `app.config.ts` under the `expo-location`
plugin block — but only a fresh `npm run prebuild` writes them into
`ios/<app>/Info.plist`. If you edited the plugin block (or the iOS
native folder was generated before the plugin was added) the plist
falls out of sync.

Fix paths:

1. **Canonical**: `npm run prebuild` to regenerate the iOS native tree
   (also re-runs `pod install` and the `patch-podfile.js` Podfile
   fixes). Required before the next iOS rebuild.
2. **Quick unblock** (between prebuilds): manually patch
   `ios/<AppName>/Info.plist` with both `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`
   and `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` keys using the
   same strings the plugin block configures. The next `npm run prebuild`
   produces identical content, so the patch is idempotent.

A native rebuild (`npm run ios`) is required either way — a JS reload
won't pick up the plist change.

## AI best practices

### Do

- Use `Result.ok` / `Result.err` for all expected failures.
- Read `REFACTOR_PLAN.md` and the most recent `docs/PHASE_*.md` before
  starting a turn — they document scope decisions and deferred work.
- Match legacy field shapes exactly (read the legacy
  `src/api/firebase/<X>.js` source before writing a DTO/mapper for that
  collection).
- Build the in-memory fake repository BEFORE the real Firestore one;
  the contract is firmer that way.
- Use synchronous unsubscribe for all subscriptions.
- For new screens: write a `useXxxViewModel` hook alongside it, keep
  the screen body dumb (props in, JSX out), and test the view-model in
  isolation against in-memory repository fakes via
  `TestContainerProvider`.
- Server state goes in TanStack Query; client/UI state goes in Zustand.
  Don't mix.
- When in doubt about a legacy quirk, check the legacy
  `/Users/papagallo/yeapptech/dev/yeride/CLAUDE.md` — it captures most
  of the trial-and-error history.
- Always update `eslint.config.js` boundaries overrides if introducing a
  cross-layer import (only do this for legitimate composition-root
  files).

### Don't

- Don't `console.*` outside the logger.
- Don't `throw` for domain failures — return `Result.err`.
- Don't put business logic in repositories. Logic belongs in entities or
  domain services.
- Don't import data-layer types into domain. Domain knows nothing.
- Don't put presentation code (Zustand stores, navigation, screens) in
  app/use cases.
- Don't forget the DI container is the only place lazy-`require()` is
  acceptable. Everywhere else uses static imports.
- Don't skip the verify gates before committing.
- Don't return promises from subscription methods (legacy footgun
  explicitly fixed).
- Don't put fetched ride/route/payment data in a Zustand store — that's
  what TanStack Query is for. Don't put a UI flag (banner-visible,
  sheet-open) in TanStack Query — that's what Zustand is for.
- Don't grow `RideMonitorScreen` or `DriverMonitorScreen` into a
  god-component. New ride status = add a `RideStatus` literal + a new
  `<Status>View` component + one case in the relevant side's
  status-router. Each view stays prop-driven and independently
  testable.

### Driver-side specifics (Phase 4)

A handful of patterns are specific to the driver-side surfaces. Read
these before touching `useDriverHomeViewModel`,
`useDriverDispatchViewModel`, `useDriverMonitorViewModel`, or any of
the four driver status views.

- **Driver mode mirror.** `useDriverStatusStore` carries a
  `mode: 'offline' | 'online_idle' | 'dispatched' | 'on_trip'` flag.
  `useDriverMonitorViewModel` mirrors `Ride.status` into this flag so
  DriverHome / the tabs / a future Earnings surface don't have to
  re-derive from the in-progress ride query at every read. New ride
  status that the driver should see = update the mirror's switch in
  the VM. `cancelled` always maps to `'online_idle'` (driver re-joins
  the queue); `started` / `payment_requested` / `payment_failed` /
  `completed` all map to `'on_trip'`.
- **Client-side `arrivedAtPickup` flag.** Server status `'dispatched'`
  is split into UI states `'en_route_to_pickup'` and `'at_pickup'` via
  a single client-side bool inside `useDriverMonitorViewModel`. The
  legacy app does the same — there's no server-side `at_pickup` state.
  Phase 7's geofence-entry event will auto-flip the flag; until then
  the driver taps "Arrived at pickup" manually. The flag resets on
  every status that isn't `'dispatched'` so a defensive re-render in a
  later state can't render a stale at-pickup view.
- **Stub odometer at start / request-payment.** The VM derives a stub
  `pickupTiming.odometerMeters ?? 0` + 1 metre and passes it to both
  `useStartRideMutation` and `useRequestPaymentMutation`. This passes
  the entity's monotonicity check (`requestPayment` rejects an
  odometer below `pickupTiming.odometerMeters`) without dragging GPS
  into the test surface. Phase 7 swaps `stubOdometerMeters` for a real
  GPS reading from `useGpsLifecycle` — that's the single edit-site.
  Don't pass odometer in from the screen; the VM owns the derivation
  so the prop surface stays stable across the GPS migration.
- **Terminal-redirect rule.** `useDriverMonitorViewModel` resets the
  stack to `DriverTabs` on `'cancelled'` and `'completed'`.
  `'payment_failed'` intentionally does NOT redirect — the driver
  stays on the failure card and taps "Close trip" themselves
  (`navigation.reset` from the screen). The `redirectedRef` ref guards
  against re-firing across re-renders. If you add a new terminal
  status, decide deliberately whether it auto-redirects; don't blanket
  add to the effect.
- **Two cancel-sheet variants.**
  `presentation/components/trip/CancelReasonSheet` is rider-side
  (gated on `isRiderCode`); `DriverCancelReasonSheet` is driver-side
  (gated on `isDriverCode`). They diverge on the available code list
  (`driver_no_show` rider-only; `passenger_no_show` driver-only) and
  on copy. Both build the `CancellationReason` value object and hand
  it to `onConfirm` — the parent owns submission. Both have an
  explicit `onPress={() => undefined}` on the inner card Pressable to
  absorb press-bubbling under `@testing-library/react-native`'s
  `fireEvent.press` AND to avoid a latent dismiss-on-card-tap touch
  bug in production.
- **DriverMonitor map polyline rules.** The map keeps a fixed pool of
  always-mounted children (the `<Map/>` component's invariant). Drive
  visibility via props:
  - Green driver→pickup polyline (`pickupRoute`): visible during
    server status `'dispatched'`. Hidden in every other state.
  - Gold pickup→dropoff polyline (`selectedRoute`): visible during
    `'started'` / `'payment_requested'` / `'payment_failed'` /
    `'completed'`. Both pickup and dropoff markers stay mounted
    across late-status transitions so the map doesn't visibly redraw.
